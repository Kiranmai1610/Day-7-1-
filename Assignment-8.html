      appeared in Trivikram Srinivas's Attarintiki Daredi. The film, released on
      27 September 2013, faced problems with piracy as half of the movie was
      leaked to the internet prior to its release.[46] In spite of this the
      movie was a blockbuster in 2013. The movie completed 100 days in 33
      theaters and held the record of the highest-grossing film in Tollywood by
      that time, surpassing the previous record of Magadheera (2009).[47] Later,

      directed by Kishore Kumar Pardasani. In 2016, Kalyan's Sardaar Gabbar
      Singh, a sequel to his 2012 film Gabbar Singh received mixed-to-negative
      reviews from critics. Katamarayudu (2017), a remake of Tamil film Veeram
      marked his second collaboration with Kishore Kumar Pardasani. In 2018, he
      appeared in the film Agnyaathavaasi directed by Trivikram Srinivas. This
      marked Kalyan's 25th film.[51] In 2021, he made a comeback to films by

      Veera Mallu, which is being directed by Krish Jagarlamudi. The shooting of

      political commitments. Mythri Movie Makers also announced Ustaad Bhagat
      Singh with Kalyan, under the direction of Harish Shankar.[52] He also

      Chiranjeevi. He neither contested in elections nor did he hold any
      constitutional post during his days in Praja Rajyam Party. While he
      actively campaigned for the party, he was also hit with few health
      problems. Kalyan was struck with bouts of vomiting, as he was hit by a
      sunstroke during a roadshow at Vizag on 19 April 2009.[56] Later, in 2011,
      when Chiranjeevi merged his party[57] with the Congress Party,[58] Kalyan
      took a break from political life, expressing his silent discontent with
      his brother's decision to merge the party.[59] Jana Sena Party Kalyan
      founded a political party named Jana Sena Party on 14 March
      2014.[60][61][62] He wrote a book titled Ism which is also the ideology of
      the Jana Sena party.[63] He met with then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
      Prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi to discuss the issues related to
      both the Telugu states and extended his support.[64] He campaigned
      extensively for the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and BJP alliance in Andhra
      Pradesh and Telangana. He opposed Congress party's rule stating the slogan
      Congress Hatao, Desh Bachao (lit. 'Stop Congress, Save the Country' in
      Hindi).[65] His rallies drew what the Deccan-Journal called "huge crowds"
      in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.[66] In August 2017, he announced that he
      intended to enter full-time politics starting October 2017 once he
      completes his film commitments.[67] Kalyan brought the Uddanam kidney
      disease crisis to the attention of media and politicians through protests
      and a hunger strike. Government of Andhra Pradesh responded by
      constructing dialysis centers and implementing various schemes for the
      village.[68][69] In November 2016, Kalyan announced that Jana Sena will
      contest in the 2019 general elections in Andhra Pradesh.[70] He stated
      that he was planning to contest from all 175 legislatures of Andhra
      Pradesh without any alliance.[71] He opposed central government's move to
      privatise Dredging Corporation of India (DCI)[72] on a golden platter.[73]
      Kalyan led a protest march to condolence farmers who committed suicides or
      migrated from the drought-prone regions of Rayalaseema.[74] He opposed the
      TDP Government's decision on land pooling.[75] Kalyan conducted a march on
      the historical Dowleswaram Barrage in Rajahmundry demanding political
      accountability.[76] He exposed the alleged unchecked mining in the reserve
      forest area at Vanthada village of Prathipadu in East Godavari
      district.[77] Kalyan announced the Jana Sena party's 2019 election
      manifesto at Rajahmundry[78] public meeting with many measures to improve
      the lives of farmers,[79] farm labourers, women, youth, and students. His
      party would contest together with left parties[80] Communist Party of
      India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), and Bahujan Samaj Party[81] for
      the upcoming 2019 elections in both Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and
      Telangana. At the same time, when he was actively campaigning for the
      elections all around Andhra Pradesh, he fell sick and shared a few health
      problems. As he was getting ready for his next round of campaign at
      Sattenapalle, he felt dizzy and nauseated. When the chopper was down for
      refilling at Gannavaram airport, he was down with vomiting, dehydration,
      and drowsiness. Immediately then, he was hospitalized and treated in
      Vijayawada. Again the campaign resumed after he got well.[82][83] Jana
      Sena Party contested in 140 constituencies in the 2019 Andhra Pradesh
      Legislative Assembly election, of which, Kalyan contested in two
      constituencies – Gajuwaka[84] and Bhimavaram.[85] He lost in both
      constituencies to candidates from YSR Congress Party.[86] His party was
      able to win from Razole, making it the only seat it won in the
      election.[87] Later the same year, on 3 November 2019, Kalyan led a long
      march in Visakhapatnam in support of construction workers, against YSR
      Congress Party, who have been facing unemployment due to a shortage of
      supply of sand in Andhra Pradesh.[88] On 16 January 2020, Kalyan announced
      his party's alliance with BJP, after three years of distancing from
      it.[89] On 12 February 2020, he led a rally for justice to Sugali Preethi,
      a 15-year-old girl who was raped and murdered, in Kurnool.[90] He demanded
      an inquiry by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the incident.[91]
      Jana Sena Party formed a triple alliance with Telugu Desam Party and BJP
      and contested in 21 constituencies in the 2024 Andhra Pradesh Legislative
      Assembly election, with Kalyan contesting in the Pithapuram constituency.
      He won by a margin of more than 70,000 votes; Jana Sena Party won in all
      the contested twenty-one assembly constituencies and two Lok Sabha
      seats.[92] On 12 June 2024, he was sworn in as a cabinet minister of
      Andhra Pradesh, whereas on 16 June 2024, he was announced as the deputy
      chief minister.[93] He is also serving as the Minister of Panchayat Raj &

      evidence.[105] Subsequently, in July 2007, Kalyan filed for divorce at a

      by Kalyan as a one-time settlement.[106][107] In 2009, Kalyan married

      Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the
      film.[23] The other release was Nijam co-starring Rakshita.[24] Babu
      received praise from critics for his performance in the film, with
      Vijayalaxmi of Rediff.com calling him the only reason to watch the film's
      second half which she termed "a routine tale of vendetta".[25] He won his
      first Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film, in
      addition to his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor –
      Telugu.[26] Mainstream film (2004–2010) In 2004, Manjula produced his next
      film,[citation needed] Naani, directed by S. J. Surya co-starring Amisha

      box office.[20][non-primary source needed] He received his third Nandi

      by Gunasekhar and produced by Ramesh.[27] The film released on 18 August
      2004[28] and was successful at the box-office.[29] The film was screened
      at the International Film Festival of India in the mainstream section.
      This was Keerthi Reddy's final acting performance prior to her retirement
      from the film industry.[30] He chose to act in Trivikram Srinivas's Athadu
      (2005), co-starring Trisha Krishnan, whose script had been approved back
      in 2002 before the production of Naani and Arjun had
      begun.[31][non-primary source needed] It emerged as one of the
      highest-grossing films of the year.[32][33] The film proved to be a major
      boost for Babu's career as he received his fourth nomination for the
      Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu, in addition to fetching his second
      Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance in the role of a hired
      assassin.[34] The movie collected a share of ₹22 crores at the box
      office.[citation needed] Idlebrain.com gave it a rating of 3.25/5 and
      mentioned Mahesh Babu is stylish and brilliant as professional
      killer.[35]Cinegoer.net gave a review stating, "True the film gives an
      image of a Hollywood base for the drama. Even the taking, screenplay
      structure and execution of scenes, less talk and more action.[36] He then
      collaborated with Puri Jagannadh in 2006 for the film Pokiri, which was
      jointly produced by Jagannadh and Manjula.[37] He received high praise for
      his performance, with Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu opining that
      "Mahesh's understated performance in Pokiri allows him effortlessly to
      reclaim the title of a star, overshadowing his questionable career choices
      of late".[37] He won his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for
      his performance in the film.[38] That same year, his next film, Sainikudu,
      was released.[39] A critic from Rediff.com wrote that "Nonetheless,
      Sainikudu can be watched at least for its premise of letting the warrior
      in each individual surface, and the fact that it is done with the idea of
      motivating people to do something for their fellow humans".[40] The
      following year saw Babu acting in the film Athidhi, co-starring Amrita
      Rao, marking her Telugu debut. The film was produced by Mahesh Babu's's
      brother Ramesh.[41] UTV Motion Pictures acquired the film's distribution
      rights for ₹18.5 crore, which became its first Telugu film venture.[42]
      Jeevi of Idlebrain.com praised the film's first half while criticising the
      last thirty minutes of the film.[43] A critic from Rediff.com wrote that
      the film "is built up through a 'racy' screenplay which is gripping to an
      extent, but stretches to three long hours".[44] In 2008, Babu provided
      voice-over for the film Jalsa directed by Trivikram Srinivas.[45] After
      Athidhi's release, Babu took a break from films for seven months; two
      months later, he signed Khaleja, but the break was unintentionally
      extended for two years due to several delays. During this time, Babu's
      grandmother and his wife Namrata's parents died. Krishna was worried about
      Babu's career as the film's shoot was delayed for so long.[46] The film
      deals with illegal-mining in India, and related environmental damage.[47]
      It marks Babu's return as an actor after a three-year hiatus in his second
      collaboration with Trivikram after Athadu. Upon release, Khaleja received
      mixed reviews from critics and was a commercial failure in India.[48]
      However, it managed to perform well at the overseas box office becoming
      the highest grossing Telugu film at that time.[49] Rediff gave a 3 out of
      5 rating and noted "The duo of Mahesh-Trivikram delivers a product that is
      watchable, entertaining with good humour, couple of well-orchestrated
      action sequences and songs and with a bit to take home as well. It's
      Mahesh's show all the way, much to the delight of his fans. Mahesh is the
      soul of the movie, be it his dialogue delivery, his action, his dances or
      emotions, he is effortless.[50] The film is included in the list of "25
      Greatest Telugu Films Of The Decade" by Film Companion.[51] Stardom and
      career setback (2011–2014) In 2011, Babu collaborated with Srinu Vaitla

      Hills residence as he was rumoured of receiving a remuneration of more
      than ₹12 crore for his next projects.[56] He later played the role of a
      mafia kingpin with a hidden personal agenda in the film Businessman
      (2012), co-starring Kajal Aggarwal.[57] Upon the film's release, he
      received praise from critics for his performance in the film, with Y.
      Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu writing, "The film has no frills, no vulgar
      wastage and the hero is practically in every frame; you hear only his
      voice, he looks good, sounds good, he also steals the comedian's job.
      Mahesh plays it straight".[58] He received his seventh nomination for the
      Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and his second nomination for the
      SIIMA Award for Best Actor (Telugu) for his performance in the
      film.[59][60] By then, Babu was reported to be the second highest-paid
      actor in South India after Rajinikanth.[61] Babu then began filming for
      Srikanth Addala's Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (2013), whose script
      Babu had approved during the pre-production phase of Dookudu.[62]

      Prabhu, it became the first Telugu multistarrer film to be produced in the
      last twenty-five years.[63] Released in January 2013, the film became one
      of the highest grossing Telugu films of the year and marked the completion
      of Babu's hat-trick of successful films.[64] Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The
      Hindu called the film a "delightful family drama with its celebration of
      family bonds, love and marriage laced with laughter", and Addala "wants to
      leave his audience with a thought, wants them to reflect on their
      relationships and overlook skirmishes that can sour family bonds". Dundoo
      cited Guhan's cinematography as one of the film's highlights, and praised
      its performances.[65] He won his fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actor –
      Telugu and his second SIIMA Award for Best Actor (Telugu) for his
      performance in the film.[66][67] He provided a voice-over for Srinu
      Vaitla's Baadshah the same year.[68] Babu had two releases in 2014, the
      first one being Sukumar's 1: Nenokkadine, an action thriller focusing on a
      celebrity suffering from hallucinations related to the murder of his
      parents and the discovery of a special variety of rice.[69] Babu's
      performance received praise, with critics calling it one of his best
      performances.[70][71][72] For his performance, he received his fourth
      nomination for the SIIMA Award for Best Actor (Telugu).[73] Resurgence and
      recent work (2015–present) Babu collaborated with Koratala Siva for the
      action drama film Srimanthudu (2015) co-starring Shruti Haasan. He
      co-produced the film under his newly formed banner G. Mahesh Babu
      Entertainment Pvt. Ltd, marking his first film production venture.[74] He
      opted to do so to control the film's budget, accepting a share in profits
      in lieu of remuneration.[75] Released on 7 August 2015, Srimanthudu opened
      to positive reviews from critics,[76] and he won his fifth Filmfare Award
      for Best Actor – Telugu for the film.[77][78] Sethumadhavan N. of
      Bangalore Mirror stated, Srimanthudu wouldn't have been as effective if it
      did not have Mahesh Babu who is at his charming best, adding that he
      "underplays the emotional scenes, making them a treat to watch".[79] Babu
      also adopted his native village, Burripalem.[80] Babu won third SIIMA
      award for best actor for his performance in the film.[81] In 2016, he
      acted in the film Brahmotsavam co-starring Kajal Aggarwal, Samantha Ruth
      Prabhu and Pranitha Subhash. Originally produced as a bi-lingual, the film
      would've marked Babu's first straight-out Tamil film.[82] While the film
      underperformed at the box office, the Deccan Chronicle stated that Mahesh
      Babu was its saving grace.[83] Mahesh babu on the set of Brahmotsavam

      debut[84] and grossed over ₹118 crores at the box office.[85] The film
      received mixed reviews, with praise for the cast performances, but
      criticism for its writing, screenplay and direction.[86] Y. Sunita
      Chowdary of The Hindu stated that "Spyder starts off well but the
      director's imagination goes overboard only to turn a purpose ridden plot
      to a piece of travesty".[87] His next film was the political action drama
      Bharat Ane Nenu in 2018 where he played the role of a chief minister.[88]
      His performance in the film earned him his tenth nomination for the
      Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. His next film was Maharshi in
      2019.[89] Hemanth Kumar of Firstpost mentioned the film owes a lot to
      Mahesh Babu's conviction to pull off his role and he makes you believe in
      his characterisation so much that it doesn't feel like fiction.[90] After
      the release of the film, the concept of weekend farming (also known as
      weekend agriculture) gained more attention.[91] A new internet challenge.
      i.e. Agriculture Challenge was started, with several people do farming in
      the weekends.[92] The Statesman reported that the film has created a
      social impact on the youth and raised awareness about the issues faced by

      2022 to mixed reviews from critics.Balakrishna Ganeshan of The News Minute
      gave the film a rating of 3/5 stars and wrote "It is great to see Mahesh
      Babu shedding his macho image and wooing a woman in the film. Mahesh is a
      delight to watch in these scenes. His comic timing and dialogue delivery
      are on point".[99] [100] Haricharan Pudipeddi of the Hindustan Times
      stated "Mahesh Babu offers something fresh in his latest film. If only
      Keerty Suresh could say the same.[101] In 2024, Babu reunited with
      Trivikram Srinivas for their third collaboration in the film Guntur
      Kaaram.[102] The movie received a mixed response from critics as well as
      the audience while Mahesh stole the show in the action drama. Philanthropy
      Mahesh Babu established, "Mahesh Babu Foundation", to improve the lives of
      underprivileged children and communities. The foundation primarily focuses
      on supporting children in need by funding life-saving congenital heart
      surgeries. The foundation also co-runs the charitable trust and non-profit
      organisation "Heal A Child" in collaboration with Andhra Hospitals and
      Rainbow Hospitals.[7] It also recognises the importance of education and
      provides scholarships to meritorious students from underprivileged
      backgrounds. Recognizing the need for holistic development, the Mahesh
      Babu Foundation adopted two villages, Burripalem in Andhra Pradesh and
      Siddhapuram in Telangana. In these villages, the foundation has undertaken
      various initiatives to improve the quality of life, including constructing
      schools, Anganwadi buildings, libraries, roads, and drainage systems.
      Additionally, they have established computer labs to equip villagers with
      crucial digital skills. The foundation also conducts regular medical
      checkups, distributes medicines to those in need, and has fully vaccinated
      the entire population of the adopted villages against COVID-19. Through
      health awareness programs, the foundation strives to empower villagers to
      make informed decisions about their well-being.[103] Babu has also
      supported AIG Hospitals' "End Corona Campaign", which was aimed at
      creating awareness about the COVID-19 vaccine.[104] It was one of the
      world's largest virtual awareness campaigns on the COVID-19 vaccine.[105]
      He was signed in 2013 as the goodwill ambassador of Heal-a-child
      Foundation, a non-profit organisation that offers financial support to the
      parents of terminally ill children to help with the cost of medical
      treatment.[106] Babu gives 30% of his annual income to charities, and most
      of his philanthropic activities are unpublicised because he prefers them
      to be so.[107] He joined Farhan Akhtar's Men Against Rape and
      Discrimination (MARD) campaign in August 2013 and lent his voice to the
      Telugu version of a poem written by Javed Akhtar.[108] In October 2014, he
      donated ₹25 lakh to a relief fund run by the chief minister of Andhra
      Pradesh for reconstruction of areas destroyed during Cyclone Hudhud.[109]

      "Allu Arjun is pretty excellent in the first half as the characterization
      in the first half is vibrant and needs loads of energy. He carried the
      entire first half on his shoulders. He excelled in the emotional scenes in
      the second half."[41] Writing for Rediff.com, Radhikha Rajamani stated

      of grey.[44] Sify wrote that "Allu Arjun is full of energy as the guy
      caught in the powerful current of love. Though he plays the part with
      negative shades, his characterization could evoke a lot of sympathy from
      the audiences. His dances are mind-blowing and he excels in emotional
      scenes."[45] Oneindia appreciated his dance moves and acting performances,

      a good dancer and does justice to his role."[55] Another critic wrote that

      film. Further success (2011–2013) He next appeared in V. V. Vinayak's

      Vietnam[58][59] and marks his first pairing with Tamannaah.[60] He grew
      his hair out for his look as a warrior in the film.[citation needed] It
      his second A-rated film in India after Vedam (2010), on the account of
      graphic action violence.[61] The film completed a 50-day run in 187
      cinemas.[62] His performance and character received mixed reviews.[63][64]
      A critic of The Times of India wrote that "Arjun hardly has any scope to
      emote as he was mostly pushed into action scenes and song sequences."[65]
      After Badrinath, he signed Trivikram Srinivas's action comedy film Julayi
      in 2011.[66] It was released in 2012, in which he played the role of
      Ravindra Narayan, a street-smart yet spoilt brat whose life takes a
      drastic turn after he becomes the witness of a huge bank robbery. A critic
      wrote that "Allu Arjun puts in a confident performance as the loveable
      rogue. It's a role that is right up his alley and he carries it off with a
      characteristic panache. He lights up the screen with his dancing in
      particular, pulling off some pretty challenging dance moves."[67] Riya
      Chakravarty of NDTV, in her review, stated that "Arjun has delivered an
      outstanding performance."[68] He was nominated for the SIIMA Award for
      Best Actor – Telugu, for his performance in the film. The next year, he
      starred in Puri Jagannadh's action thriller Iddarammayilatho, playing
      Sanju Reddy, a guitarist with a dark past, alongside Amala Paul and
      Catherine Tresa. Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu praised his
      performance in the action sequences and dance moves in various songs in
      the film, adding "Allu Arjun uses his agility to his advantage in dances
      and stunt episodes".[69] Another critic wrote that "True to his tag of
      "stylish star", Allu Arjun looks trendier than ever before. His character
      of a guitarist, who is a street performer in Barcelona, was at its best
      sketchy, and looks completely different from his previous films. He once
      again proves that he is a good actor and probably because of the action
      director's meticulous planning, he makes perfect expressions in all the
      fight scenes."[70][71] The film marks his second and last collaboration,
      with Puri Jagannadh after Desamuduru (2007). Commercial success
      (2014–2018) In 2014, he appeared in a cameo role in Vamsi Paidipally's
      action thriller film Yevadu, alongside Kajal Aggarwal.[72][73] Y. Sunita
      Chowdary of The Hindu, in her review, wrote that "Allu Arjun shows what an
      actor can do even in a short role, in the few minutes he packs his
      experience, internalises the character and makes an impressive exit even
      as he loses his identity."[74] His next film was Surender Reddy's Race
      Gurram, in which he played Allu Lakshman "Lucky" Prasad, a carefree
      guy.[75] He joined the production of the film in May 2013.[76] The film
      was successful at the box office, with the film being Allu's first ₹100
      crore grosser.[77] Writing to Deccan Chronicle, Suresh Kavirayani felt
      that Allu Arjun steals the show with his energetic performance and also
      praised his dancing skills in the film.[78] Ranjani Rajendra too praised
      his dance moves, comic acting and performance in the action sequences, but
      felt that the story is predictable and routine.[79] For his performance,
      he won his third Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu[80] and was
      nominated for the SIIMA Award for Best Actor – Telugu for the second time
      after Julayi. Allu Arjun produced and acted in a short film I Am That
      Change, which was released in August 2014. The film was directed by
      Sukumar,[81] to spread awareness on individual social responsibility. Upon
      its release, the short film received viral response online and was
      acclaimed by many including celebrities for its concept and execution.[82]
      It was screened in theaters across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.[83] Allu
      Arjun next appeared in Trivikram Srinivas's S/O Satyamurthy (2015), which
      was released on 9 April 2015.[84] The film was a commercial success, with
      critics praising his performance.[85][86] His performance in the film
      earned him his seventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor –
      Telugu. Following the film, he next played Gona Ganna Reddy in Guna
      Sekhar's biographical action film Rudhramadevi (2015).[87][better source
      needed] The film based on the life of Rudrama Devi, is the first Indian 3D
      historical film.[88][89] He has learned and was seen speaking in the
      Telangana Telugu, for the character in the film.[90] The Times of India
      called his performance "impeccable" and "whistle-worthy".[91] Due to the
      wide response and popularity for the character Gona Ganna Reddy, in 2021
      director Guna Sekhar said that he will be directing a film solely based on
      the character, with Allu Arjun in the lead role, after Shaakuntalam.[92]
      For Rudhramadevi, he won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor –
      Telugu and became the only actor to win both the Filmfare Award for Best
      Actor – Telugu and the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor – Telugu.
      He also won three other awards for his performance, including Nandi Award
      for Best Character Actor. In 2016, he acted in Sarrainodu, directed by
      Boyapati Srinu.[93] Although the film received negative reviews for the
      screenplay and story,[94][95] it was a major commercial success at the box
      office, grossing over ₹127.6 crore.[96] Allu Arjun called it as a
      "landmark film" in his career.[97] His performance in the action scenes
      and dance numbers was praised.[98] HIs performance in the film won him the
      Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor – Telugu, in addition to his eighth
      nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. The same year,
      in June, he announced his next film with producer Dil Raju for the third
      time for DJ: Duvvada Jagannadham. Released in 2017,[99] the film directed
      by Harish Shankar,[100] in which he played the role of Duvvada Jagannadham
      "DJ" Shastri, alongside Pooja Hegde, Rao Ramesh and Subbaraju.[101] He
      appears as a caterer, who is an undercover cop. Firstpost's Hemanth Kumar
      praised his dance and wrote that "look beyond Allu Arjun's classy moves in
      Seeti Maar and Asmaika Yoga, all you find is a story that struggles to
      find its rhythm."[102] India Today too lauded his dance but criticised the
      film's screenplay and called it "Boring-ah, bore-asya, bore-obiah".[103]
      The next year, in May, his film under the direction of writer turned
      director Vakkantham Vamsi, Naa Peru Surya, Naa Illu India was released. He
      played Surya, an Indian Army soldier who has anger management issues.[104]
      Allu Arjun spent considerable time learning the tricks and stunt sequences
      from professionals, especially for the dance numbers and action
      sequences.[105] Upon release, the film received mixed reviews and was
      successful at the box office. A critic called his performance as Allu
      Arjun's "career-best" and cited it as the "biggest strength to the
      film".[106] Vyas of The Hans India stated that "Allu Arjun is supremely
      talented and has delivered an energetic performance in the movie."[107]
      Hindustan Times's Priyanka Sundar opined that "Allu Arjun tries to do his
      best in the shoes of a soldier, but at places we see that it looks
      forced."[108] Pushpa and beyond (2019–present) In December 2018, his next
      project Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo was announced, with Trivikram Srinivas as
      the director.[109] Pooja Hegde was selected to play the female lead
      role,[110] thus marking his second collaboration with Hegde after DJ:
      Duvvada Jagannadham.[111] He joined the production of the film in April
      2019.[112] Produced jointly by Allu Aravind and S. Radha Krishna, the film
      marks the third collaboration of Allu Arjun and Trivikram after Julayi
      (2012) and S/O Satyamurthy (2015).[113] The film was released in January
      2020.[114] Allu Arjun's performance received highly positive reviews. A
      review posted by Rohit Mohan on Koimoi said that "Be it comedy, action,
      emotions, style and of course dance, the star actor nails it in the film,
      as 'Bunny' made to audience groove to his tunes with his act."[115] Film
      Companion felt that Allu Arjun's performance in the board-room scene was
      the highlight of the film.[116] Bhavana Sharma of International Business
      Times, opined that Allu Arjun went into the skin of the character.[117]
      The film his career's highest grosser and stands among the
      highest-grossing Telugu films. Allu Arjun's dance performance in the song
      "Butta Bomma" received wide response.[118] In 2021, he re-united with
      Sukumar, after nearly a decade, for Pushpa: The Rise.[119] The film is
      based on the red sanders smuggling in the Seshachalam Hills in Andhra
      Pradesh and Allu Arjun plays Pushpa Raj, a coolie-turned-smuggler,
      alongside Fahadh Faasil and Rashmika Mandanna.[120] The film was released
      in December 2021 to mixed reviews but his performance was praised.[121] A
      reviewer from The Indian Express wrote, "Allu Arjun walks away with the
      film with his strong performance. He embraces his deglamorized look and
      delivers a memorable performance."[122] The Times of India critic Neeshita
      Nyayapati stated: "Pushpa: The Rise is Allu Arjun's show all the way. He
      shines in playing this rustic character that is hard on the surface but
      vulnerable in ways that others don't see."[123] The film proved to be a
      major commercial success, grossing over ₹350 crore and emerged as the
      highest grossing Indian film in 2021.[124] He won his fourth Filmfare
      Award for Best Actor – Telugu alongside National Film Award for Best Actor
      for his performance, of which the latter became a first for a Telugu film
      actor.[125][126][127] Allu Arjun's performance along with one of the
      dialogues from the film, "Thaggede Le" achieved the cult status and made a
      huge impact in the Indian pop culture scene.[128][129] A sequel titled
      Pushpa 2: The Rule is in production,[130] and is scheduled to release on 6
      December 2024.[131]

    <p>
      Konidela Ram Charan[1][2] (born 27 March 1985) is an Indian actor and film
      producer who primarily works in Telugu cinema. He is one of the
      highest-paid actors in Indian cinema[3][4] and has featured in Forbes
      India's Celebrity 100 list since 2013. Charan is the recipient of several
      awards, including three Filmfare Awards and two Nandi Awards. Charan made
      his acting debut with the action film Chirutha (2007), a box office hit,
      winning the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut – South. He rose to
      prominence starring in S. S. Rajamouli's fantasy action film Magadheera
      (2009), the highest-grossing Telugu film of all time at the time of its
      release, winning the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. He went on to
      star in notable films such as Racha (2012), Naayak (2013), Yevadu (2014),
      Govindudu Andarivadele (2014), and Dhruva (2016). Charan achieved further
      commercial success with the blockbusters Rangasthalam (2018), winning his
      second Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu, and RRR (2022), which
      currently ranks as the third-highest-grossing Indian film of all time and
      his highest grosser. Charan emerged as a pan-Indian star with RRR and
      earned international recognition, including a nomination at the Critics'
      Choice Super Awards for Best Actor in an Action Movie. Charan has also
      been honoured at Indian Film Festival of Melbourne (IFFM) 2024 for his
      stellar performance in RRR.[5] In 2016, Charan launched his own production
      house Konidela Production Company, which has notably backed Khaidi No. 150
      (2017) and Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy (2019). Beyond his film career, he owns
      the polo team Hyderabad Polo and Riding Club and was a co-owner of the
      airline service TruJet. Early life and family Main article: Allu–Konidela
      family Ram Charan was born in Madras (now Chennai) in a Telugu family to
      actor Chiranjeevi and his wife Surekha on 27 March 1985.[6][7] His family
      hails from Mogalthur and Palakollu in the West Godavari district of Andhra
      Pradesh.[8][9] His maternal grandfather was the noted comic actor Allu
      Ramalingaiah.[10] He has two siblings — an older sister Sushmitha and
      younger sister Sreeja.[11] Ram Charan was educated at Padma Seshadri Bala
      Bhavan, Chennai,[12] Lawrence School, Lovedale,[13] The Hyderabad Public
      School, Begumpet,[14] and at the St. Mary's College, Hyderabad.[15] He
      also attended Kishore Namit Kapoor's acting school in Mumbai.[16][17] He
      was presented with an honorary doctorate from Vels University, Chennai in
      April 2024.[18] Acting career 2007–2009: Debut and breakthrough In 2007,
      Charan made his film debut as the leading actor in Chirutha, an action
      film directed by Puri Jagannadh which completed 50 days in 178 direct
      cinemas and 15 other shifted cinemas.[19] He played the role of Charan, an
      ex-convict seeking to kill his father's murderer. Rediff.com praised his
      performance, stating: "Ram Charan is quite promising. Dance and action
      appear to be forte. He is rather graceful in the dance numbers. He also
      stays clear of any oblique reference to his star father by way of dialogue
      or adopting any particular mannerism or style."[20] His performance in the
      film earned him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut – South and the
      Nandi Special Jury Award.[21][22] After the release of his second film,
      the fantasy film Magadheera (2009), Charan established himself as one of
      the leading contemporary actors in Tollywood. The film, in which he played
      dual roles, was directed by S. S. Rajamouli, and Charan's performance was
      critically acclaimed. The Times of India stated that "Ram Charan returns
      as a valiant soldier and breathes life into the larger-than-life role with
      ease. He showcases his horse-riding and dancing skills to perfection."[23]
      IndiaGlitz commented: "Charan has come up with a mature performance and he
      has carried the film very well. Both his characters were done justice, and
      he reminded of his father at many places."[24] Magadheera grossed over
      ₹150 crores worldwide and held the record of being the highest-grossing
      Telugu film until 2013 before it was surpassed by Attarintiki Daredi.[25]
      The film received six Filmfare Awards including two awards – Filmfare
      Award for Best Actor – Telugu and the Nandi Special Jury Award for
      Charan.[26] 2010–2013: Career fluctuations Charan starred in Bommarillu
      Bhaskar's urban romance Orange in 2010 as Ram, a NRI living in
      Australia.[27] Although the film didn't perform well at the box office,
      critics praised the storyline and performance by Charan.[28] Jeevi of
      Idlebrain felt that Charan didn't try to stick to stardom and is not
      willing to repeat the mistakes performed by other stars.[29] Over the
      years, it became a cult film and received appreciation from the
      audience.[30] In her article for Film Companion, Alekhya Devarakonda
      compared his character to Howard Roark of 1943 novel The Fountainhead.[31]
      Following a year-long absence from the screen, he next appeared in Racha
      (2012), directed by Sampath Nandi. He played the role of "Betting Raj", a
      gambler. The film completed a 100-day run in 38 centres across Andhra
      Pradesh on 13 July 2012.[32] Racha's final share for its distributors was
      ₹45 crore (equivalent to ₹85 crore or US$10 million in 2023).[33] His
      performance in the film earned him acting nominations at the Filmfare and
      SIIMA award ceremonies.[34][35] Sify stated, "Both, actor Ram Charan and
      his director Sampath Nandi play a safe game by following the same pattern
      of earlier mass-masala movies."[36] Radhika Rajamani of Rediff criticised
      the plot of the film, but praised Charan's performance in action sequences
      and dance moves.[37] IndiaGlitz wrote: "He shows flashes of Chiru-ness
      more than he ever did in the past; be it his baritone or demeanor, he is a
      megastar in effect. Helped by a strong script, he could have been much
      better."[38] The film was released on 5 April 2012 and was declared a
      commercial success.[39] Charan with Priyanka Chopra during promotions of
      their film Zanjeer in 2013 Charan had two films released in 2013. His
      first release was Naayak, directed by V. V. Vinayak, in which he played a
      dual role, once again after Magadheera. Writing to The Times of India,
      Karthik Pasupulate wrote that "Ram Charan did a great job, though there
      was no variation shown between the two characters."[40] It opened to mixed
      critical reviews and became a commercial success.[41] The film brought him
      two nominations – the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and the SIIMA
      Award for Best Actor (Telugu), once again, with a Best Actor award at TSR
      – TV9 National Film Awards.[42] The same year he made his Hindi cinema
      debut alongside Priyanka Chopra in the Telugu-Hindi bilingual film
      Zanjeer, a remake of the 1973 film of the same name.[43][44] He played the
      role of ACP Vijay Khanna who swears vengeance on his parents' killer.
      Charan made his debut as a playback singer with the song "Mumbai Ke Hero",
      composed by Chirrantan Bhatt, from the album Thoofan, the Telugu version
      of Zanjeer.[45] Rediff called it as "an unforgivably bad remake."[46] Film
      critic Rajeev Masand criticised his performance writing that he "comes off
      as stiff as a wax statue in his Bollywood debut, with barely any emotion,
      forget brooding anger."[47] Amid huge expectations, the film became a
      box-office bomb.[48][49] 2014–2015: Continued career The following year
      saw Charan with two releases. Yevadu (2014), directed by Vamsi Paidipally
      is the third film in which he played the dual role, one who has received a
      face transplant of the other and becomes the target of underworld gangs
      because of the mistaken identity. The Central Board of Film Certification
      gave the film an 'A' certificate because of its violent action
      sequences.[50] Bangalore Mirror wrote that "For Ram Charan, Yevadu is
      essential to establish his status after Thoofan tanked at the box office.
      His character has two shades, and he tries his best to bring variations.
      He dances like there is no tomorrow and the choreography is a delight to
      watch."[51] A critic of Sify compared Charan's performance to his earlier
      films – Nayak and Thoofan and commented that he has done a fairly good job
      here.[52] Y. Sunita Chowdhary of The Hindu felt that Charan did well in
      the dance sequences than his acting in the role.[53] His second release of
      the same year was the family drama Govindudu Andarivadele.[54] The film
      features him as a NRI from the United Kingdom.[55] The film opened to
      mostly positive reviews from critics,[56] and grossed over ₹40 crore
      (equivalent to ₹64 crore or US$7.7 million in 2023) at the box office.[57]
      Sangeetha Devi Dundoo commented that he has given his best performance
      after Magadheera.[58] Similarly Suresh Kaviyarani of the Deccan Chronicle
      too praised him and cited Charan's performance as "good" and "subtle".[59]
      He next played an IB Officer and a stunt performer in the Srinu Vaitla's
      action comedy film Bruce Lee: The Fighter (2015).[60] Charan hired
      Priyanka Chopra's trainer Samir Jaura in mid-July 2014 to get into shape
      for this film by following an intensive training program designed by
      Jaura, lasting for four-five months along with a strict diet. He also
      began learning Karate for his role in mid May 2015.[61] For the role, he
      sported a tattoo of Bruce Lee on his hand.[62] The film collected more
      than ₹12.66 crore, on its opening day, registering the highest opening day
      collection of Ram Charan's film.[63] Over days the film didn't performed
      well at the box office[64] and was declared as a box-office bomb,[65] with
      a budget of ₹60 crore.[66] Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu once again
      criticised Charan's performance and wrote that "Charan dances like a
      dream, as always, and shows marked improvement as an actor. But what he
      needs is a project that will not belittle the huge fan base in the garb of
      masala."[67] 2016–2018: Dhruva and Rangasthalam commercial success He next
      appeared in 2016 the action thriller film Dhruva (2016), where he played
      as an IPS officer.[68] The film follows the story of Dhruva, an IPS
      officer who wants to arrest Siddharth Abhimanyu (played by Arvind Swami),
      a wealthy scientist, who uses secret medical and illegal practices for
      profit.[69] A remake of the Tamil film Thani Oruvan (2015), the film
      opened to positive reviews and emerged as a commercial success at the box
      office, collecting over ₹85 crore (US$10 million) in 21 days.[70] Krishna
      Vamsi of The Indian Express wrote that "From his physique to his fights,
      he makes you hark back to Magadheera."[71] The Times of India's Srividya
      Palaparthi added "Ram Charan looks his fittest best. As an actor, Ram
      Charan impresses in all the scenes that required high emotion. And as for
      the scenes where he had to be elevated as the hero, they will not
      disappoint his fans."[72] He performed his own stunts in the film.[73] He
      received his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor –
      Telugu for his performance in the film. Charan made a cameo appearance in
      "Ammadu Let's Do Kummudu" song from the film Khaidi No. 150 (2017),
      alongside his father Chiranjeevi, Devi Sri Prasad, and Kajal Aggarwal.[74]
      The film marked the comeback of his father into the mainstream cinema
      after Shankar Dada Zindabad (2007).[75] In 2018, he appeared in the
      Sukumar's directed period action-drama Rangasthalam, which earned him
      particular praise for his performance as Chitti Babu, a semi-deaf
      villager, with several critics deeming it to be his career-best
      performance.[76][77][78] The film also emerged as a major commercial
      success, becoming the highest-grossing Telugu film of the year,[79] with a
      gross collection of over ₹216 crores.[80] Set in the 1980s in the
      Konaseema region of Andhra Pradesh, the film explores various themes
      including caste-based honour killings, brahminical patriarchy and good
      versus evil.[81][82] The film was featured on several year-end best films'
      charts.[83][84] Nagarjuna Rao of Gulf News wrote that "There comes a
      career-best for all actors at some point of time. Rangasthalam could well
      be Ram Charan's"[85] Subhash K. Jha of The Free Press Journal commented
      Teja transforms in front of our eyes, adding "It is almost like watching a
      magic show where the entire appearance of the actor undergoes a sea change
